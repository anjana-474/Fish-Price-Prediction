# Fish Weight Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the weight of fish based on various physical measurements using a linear regression model.

# Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- Category: Numerical category identifier for the species.
- Species: Type of fish (e.g., Bream).
- Weight: Weight of the fish in grams.
- Height: Height of the fish in cm.
- Width: Width of the fish in cm.
- Length1: Length from the nose to the beginning of the tail in cm.
- Length2: Length from the nose to the notch of the tail in cm.
- Length3: Total length from nose to tail in cm.

# Library Packages

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

# Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and explore the data. <br>
Handle any missing values and encode categorical features if necessary.

# Feature Selection:
Identify relevant features for predicting fish weight.

# Model Development:
Split the data into training and testing sets.<br>
Train a linear regression model using the training set.

# Prediction:
Use the model to predict weights on new fish data.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of linear regression in predicting fish weight based on measurable physical characteristics. The results show the effectiveness of linear regression for this type of predictive task.
